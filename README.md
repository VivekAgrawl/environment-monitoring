# Analyzing Insights for Environmental Monitoring Using Python & MySQL
Analyzing Insights for Environmental Monitoring and Analysis Using Python and MySQL refers to the process of utilizing the Python programming language and MySQL database to collect, analyze, and interpret data for environmental monitoring and analysis purposes.

## Project Description
This project has trained me on how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

### Module 1 Data Preprocessing
Task 1. Preprocessing the data

Task 2. Renaming the columns

Task 3. Checking for null values

Task 4. Removing duplicates

Task 5. Handling missing values

Task 6. Data type conversion

Task 7. Exporting the cleaned dataset

Task 8. Generate tables using the cleaned dataset

### Data Analysis using SQL
Task 1. Find the average temperature recorded for each device. The task is to calculate the average temperature recorded for each device in the dataset.

Task 2. Retrieve the top 5 devices with the highest average carbon monoxide levels. This task involves identifying the devices with the highest average carbon monoxide levels and retrieving the top 5 devices based on this metric.

Task 3. Calculate the average temperature recorded in the cleaned_environment table. The objective is to Determine the average temperature recorded in the cleaned_environment dataset.

Task 4. Find the timestamp and temperature of the highest recorded temperature for each device. This task requires identifying the highest recorded temperature for each device and retrieving the corresponding timestamp and temperature values.

Task 5. Identify devices where the temperature has increased from the minimum recorded temperature to the maximum recorded temperature. The goal is to Identify devices where the temperature has increased from the minimum recorded temperature to the maximum recorded temperature

Task 6. Find the timestamps and devices where carbon monoxide level exceeds the average carbon monoxide level of all devices. The objective is to identify the timestamps and devices where the carbon monoxide level exceeds the average carbon monoxide level across all devices.

Task 7. Retrieve the devices with the highest average temperature recorded. The objective is to identify the devices that have recorded the highest average temperature among all the devices in the dataset.

Task 8. Calculate the average temperature for each hour of the day across all devices. The goal is to calculate the average temperature for each hour of the day, considering data from all devices.

Task 9. Which device(s) in the cleaned environment dataset have recorded only a single distinct temperature value? The objective is to identify device(s) in the cleaned environment dataset have recorded only a single distinct temperature value.

Task 10. Find the devices with the highest humidity levels. The objective is to identify the devices that have recorded the highest humidity levels.

Task 11. Calculate the average temperature for each device, excluding outliers (temperatures beyond 3 standard deviations). This task requires calculating the average temperature for each device while excluding outliers, which are temperatures beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean.

Task 12. Retrieve the devices that have experienced a sudden change in humidity (greater than 50% difference) within a 30-minute window. The goal is to identify devices that have undergone a sudden change in humidity, where the difference is greater than 50%, within a 30-minute time window.

Task 13. Find the average temperature for each device during weekdays and weekends separately. This task involves calculating the average temperature for each device separately for weekdays and weekends.

Task 14. Calculate the cumulative sum of temperature for each device, ordered by timestamp limit to 10. The objective is to calculate the cumulative sum of temperature for each device, considering the records ordered by timestamp limit to 10
